The #WooliesWaterChallenge.
=====

This website has been created with `PHP` to simplify certain parts of development. As such, the webpage must be hosted on a server. 
To do this, a server must be hosted on the viewers machine. **NOTE:** This README is written in _Markdown_ and is meant to be viewed
on [GitHub](https://github.com/keatondejager/WSOA3000_FinalExam.git).

## Steps to Host the Webpage.

1. Download [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/) for Windows. 
2. Install and Run MAMP.
3. Once opened, go to MAMP -> Preferences
4. From this screen select the option 'Web Server'
5. Change the Document Root to this project folder.
6. Open your preferred browser, and type in the URL - _localhost_
7. Enjoy the website

## How the Site Works

* The landing page is a simple screen where the user (you) can input a message and post it to a message board. 
* The longer the message, the more followers it gains you. 
* You can use your followers to buy Woolworths water, which increases your water level. 
* If your water level reaches 0, you will start losing followers but only if your message is changed by the system (which does happen).
* If your water level is above 100, then every change that the system makes will cost a decent amount of water but also result in a bigger boost in followers. 
* Between 0 and 100 your follower gain depends on the length of the message but your water goes down by a similar amount and no changes will take place.
